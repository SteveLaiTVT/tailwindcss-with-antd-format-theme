# Tailwind CSS with Ant Design Unified Styling Demo
## Project Overview
This demonstration project showcases the integration of Tailwind CSS with Ant Design (antd) to create a unified styling system. It serves as a practical example of how to effectively combine these two popular frontend styling approaches in a React application.
## Technology Stack
- **React 19.0.0** - The latest version of the React library for building user interfaces
- **Next.js 15.3.2** - React framework for production-grade applications
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe code development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Ant Design 5.25.2** - A comprehensive UI component library
- - For Ant Design integration with Next.js **@ant-design/nextjs-registry**
- - Compatibility patch for React 19 **@ant-design/v5-patch-for-react-19**

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Next.js structure with:
- `/src/app` - Contains the main application pages and layouts
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/provider` - Context providers for application state
- - Theme configuration for unified styling `/src/theme.ts`

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to:
1. Configure Tailwind CSS and Ant Design to work harmoniously
2. Create a consistent theming system across both libraries
3. Leverage the strengths of both frameworks:
    - Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach for custom styling
    - Ant Design's comprehensive component library for complex UI elements

## Target Audience
- Frontend developers looking to combine Tailwind CSS with component libraries
- Teams seeking to standardize design systems with multiple styling approaches
- Developers exploring modern React styling solutions

This project serves as a practical reference implementation that can be used as a starting point for applications requiring both the flexibility of Tailwind CSS and the rich component ecosystem of Ant Design.
